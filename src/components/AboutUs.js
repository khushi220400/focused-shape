      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Trippy's genesis lies in the entrepreneurial spirit of its founder,
        Kalia. Initially an experienced banker at My Bank, Kalia felt the urge
        to break away from the monotony of corporate life and explore new
        avenues. After three years in the banking sector, he sought challenges
        beyond the confines of a traditional career. This quest led him to join
        AMF Bowling, aiming to introduce bowling alleys to India. Despite facing
        challenges in fundraising and the subsequent failure of this venture,
        Kalia's determination to run his own business remained unshaken.
